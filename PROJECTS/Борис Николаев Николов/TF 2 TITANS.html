    <h1 id="title">PILOTS</h1>
    <h2 id="info">Titans are mech-style robots, descended from modern-day fledgling military exoskeletons, designed for both civilian and military applications. They serve as an important element in the universe of Titanfall, even being the namesake for the series.Most
        Titans are typically deployed into battle via the process of a "Titanfall". This involves the Titan being launched out of a starship hangar bay at hyper-sonic velocities in a manner similar to a Drop Pod. This deployment method is extremely precise
        and allows the Titan to arrive on the ground in under a minute.While on a starship, Titans are constructed on-site from parts on the ship before being ready to drop. This process can take under five minutes to assemble the Titan from pre-existing
        parts.Once a battle is concluded, the IMC is known to utilise the Widow transport craft to help transport Titans back into orbit, ready for re-deployment. </h2>

            <li>Ion-Ion is a Titan class that is based on the Atlas chassis design. Laser-focused, Ion is all about power. With a central energy system that fuels all of its offensive and defensive abilities, the Ion is an effective, tactical force on The
                Frontier. Ion's primary weapon is a Splitter Rifle. The Ion has an energy bar that recharges slowly, and almost all of her attacks require using this bar (with the exception of un-split Splitter rifle and, if you have Zero-Point Tripwire,
                then deploying tripwire). Ion has relatively low damage, but its ability to take the place of almost any role on the battlefield makes this a good titan for beginners (hence the reason why it is first on the titan list, and why it is chosen
                for you at first. </li>

            <li>Scorch-Scorch is a Titan class that is based on the Ogre chassis design. Scorch's primary defensive and offensive weapon is fire. Blunt and direct, Scorch can chain his abilities to force enemies out of cover or trap them to deal maximum damage.
                Scorch achieves this using his primary weapon, the T-203 Thermite Launcher; a single-shot, break-action grenade launcher designed specifically for use with this Titan. </li>

            <li>Monarch-Monarch’s design is based on the salvaged, badly burnt up remains of two Vanguard-class Titans recovered by the IMC from the Battle of Typhon. While the Vanguard-class was designed by the Militia for armed recon deep behind enemy lines,
                the IMC’s mandate for Monarch focused on flexibility through survival and support options, to serve many operational roles.Although Vinson Dynamics was unable to reverse-engineer and replicate key aspects of the original Vanguard design,
                they brought their own R&D innovations when creating Monarch. One of these innovations is her Upgrade Core, which allows her to improve her combat abilities during a battle, based on options set by her Pilot. Monarch also has an impressive
                ability to draw power from enemy Titans to recharge her own shields, or the shields of her friendly Titans. Despite the IMC and Vinson Dynamics’ efforts to maintain secrecy, several shipments of early Monarch production variants invariably
                leaked onto the black market, allowing mercenary Pilots and independent manufacturers across the Frontier to discover her true potential. </li>

            <li>Ronin-Ronin is a Titan class that is based on the Stryder chassis design. Ronin is a hit and run specialist. He can do a lot of damage in short bursts, but his fragility makes it unwise to stay in range for too long. His speed, combined with
                Arc Wave's ability to slow, gives him the tools to get into and out of any fight. Ronin's primary weapon is the Leadwall. </li>

            <li>Tone-Tone is a Titan class that is based on the Atlas chassis, with a focus on target-locking weapons and rockets. Her 40mm Tracker Cannon still fires semi-automatic explosive shots, but has been upgraded to acquire partial locks on hostile
                Titans. Her abilities include Tracker Rockets, which fires rockets at fully locked enemies, Sonar Lock, which reveals enemies in an area and establishes partial lock, and Particle Wall, which places a transparent wall in front of Tone
                that she can shoot through. Her core ability, Salvo Core, fires a heavy barrage of guided rockets, and will gradually orient toward any target Tone looks at. Targets with a partial lock cannot be fired upon with the guided rockets - a
                full, 3-ring-segment lock must be achieved for offhand weapons to fire. </li>

            <li>Legion-Legion is a Titan class that is based on the Ogre chassis design, focusing on inexorable advances, dealing damage and controlling combat zones. He wields the Predator Cannon, which is equipped with short and long range ammo variations.
                His ordnance is known as Power Shot. While in short range mode, he fires a shotgun-like spray, which is great for taking out nearby pilots. While in long range mode, the shot is similar to the Plasma Railgun's projectile. The minigun is
                also equipped with a protective Gun Shield capable of absorbing a fair amount of damage. </li>

            <li>Northstar-Northstar is a Titan class that is based on the Stryder chassis design. Northstar is built on high mobility and precision attacks with her railgun and cluster missiles, and can perform vertical takeoffs and landings to reach more
                advantageous positions.The Northstar chassis, by default, is only capable of a short VTOL-style hover, which she can use to gain an elevated sniping position or rain missiles down on the enemy. However, extremely expensive and time-consuming
                modifications can be equipped to allow flight more akin to that of a more standard aircraft - however, these upgrades are prohibitively expensive to obtain and are available for a very small amount of Pilots such as Viper. A more standard
                modification for the majority of Pilots is the Viper Thrusters, which allow Northstar increased speed and longer flight times while in VTOL. </li>
