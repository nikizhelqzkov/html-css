                        The Hypixel Network (commonly referred to as the Hypixel Server, or simply Hypixel) is a Minecraft minigame server released on April 13, 2013, by Simon "Hypixel" Collins-Laflamme and Philippe Touchette, and is managed by Hypixel Inc. Hypixel is only available
                        on the Java Edition of Minecraft, but was formerly available on the Bedrock Edition of the game as well. Hypixel has held four Guinness World Records.

                        Hypixel has various minigames, multiplayer games created by modifying and repurposing the game mechanics of Minecraft. The server tries to find players that are hacking in its games using a mechanism named "Watchdog". Players can purchase, among other
                        things, cosmetics and ranks that allow for certain abilities and qualities.

                        The Hypixel server was released in beta on April 13, 2013, by Simon Collins-Laflamme, whose username is Hypixel, and Philippe Touchette. The two originally created Minecraft adventure maps together and uploaded trailers to their YouTube channel. The Hypixel
                        server was created to play and further showcase these maps. Minigames were originally created for users to play on while waiting for other players, but the minigames themselves gained popularity on their own and became the server's
                        main identity, and efforts from Hypixel were put towards new server content instead of the making of other Minecraft maps and games. In 2015, it was revealed that the server cost around $100,000 a month to maintain, back when the
                        server had around 16,000 players online. Today, the server regularly reaches over 100,000 concurrent players. On December 21, 2016, Hypixel reached 10 million unique players in total, and had reached 14.1 million unique players
                        by the time Hytale was announced on December 13, 2018. The server reached 18 million unique players in April 2020, according to a tweet by the server owner. As of September 15, 2015, Hypixel attracts 1.9 million players every month.
                        Around April 2018, Hypixel began to use Cloudflare Spectrum as a DDoS protection after being the victim of multiple attacks hosted by Mirai against the server.
