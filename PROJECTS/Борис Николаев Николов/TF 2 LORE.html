    <h2 id="info">Titanfall 2 is a first-person shooter video game, developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. A sequel to 2014's Titanfall, the game was released worldwide on October 28, 2016 for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In Titanfall
        2, players control Titans, mecha-style exoskeletons and their pilots, who are agile and equipped with a variety of skills ranging from wall-running to cloaking. Set in a science fiction universe, the single-player campaign follows the story of
        Jack Cooper, a rifleman from the Frontier Militia, who bonds with his mentor's Titan BT-7274 after his mentor is killed in action. Together, they embark on a quest to stop the Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation (IMC) from launching a superweapon
        that is threatening to destroy the Militia planet Harmony.The game's two-year development cycle began in mid-2014. The decision to add a single-player campaign to the game came about because the team wanted to expand the game's player base. They
        came up with different ideas and prototypes, and integrated them to form a single coherent campaign. Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet and buddy cop films, as well as the video game Half-Life inspired the game's campaign and narrative. The team
        also overhauled the progression system and made subtle changes to the multiplayer to make the gameplay more fair. Valve's Source engine powers the game. Stephen Barton returned to compose the game's music.Upon release, the game received critical
        acclaim. The single-player campaign was praised for its design and execution, and the multiplayer modes for building on the foundation of the original game. Despite the positive reception, Titanfall 2 underperformed commercially, with most attributing
        its underwhelming performance to it going on sale in a crowded release window, being placed between the release of Battlefield 1 and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. It was nominated for multiple year-end accolades including Game of the Year and
        Best Shooter awards, by several gaming publications. Respawn continued to support the game after its release, providing several updates and free downloadable content.</h2>
