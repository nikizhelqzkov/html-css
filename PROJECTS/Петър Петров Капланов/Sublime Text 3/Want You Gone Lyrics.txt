Well here we are again,
It's always such a pleasure,
Remember when you tried to kill me twice?
Oh, how we laughed and laughed,
Except I wasn't laughing,
Under the circumstances I've been shockingly nice.
You want your freedom take it,
That's what I'm counting on,
I used to want you dead but,
Now I only want you gone.
She was a lot like you,
(Maybe not quite as heavy),
Now little Caroline is in here too.
One day they woke me up,
So I could live forever,
It's such a shame the same will never happen to you.
You've got your short, sad life left,
That's what I'm counting on,
I'll let you get right to it,
Now I only want you gone.
Goodbye, my only friend,
Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny if it weren't so sad,
Well you have been replaced,
I don't need anyone now,
When I delete you maybe
I'll stop feeling so bad.(Redacted)
Go make some new disaster,
That's what I'm counting on,
You're someone else's problem,
Now I only want you gone,
Now I only want you gone,
Now I only want you gone.
