    <h1 id="title">GAMEPLAY</h1>
    <h2 id="info">Unlike its predecessor, Titanfall 2 has a single-player story campaign with gameplay split between commanding the Titan (BT-7274, voiced by Glenn Steinbaum) and controlling the Pilot (Rifleman Third Class Jack Cooper, voiced by Matthew Mercer).It
        features a linear story, but levels offer players multiple paths to explore.[10] For most parts of the game the Titan BT-7274 accompanies players, alongside allied NPCs from the universe's Frontier Militia faction (of which BT-7274 and Jack Cooper
        are a part of). He can change his weapon loadouts under players' command to maximize his efficiency when combating local wildlife, IMC infantry and other Titans. These loadouts are unlocked by finding abandoned equipment in each level, typically
        before a sequence which will benefit from the player switching to that loadout.[11] Players are able to use multiple ways to complete objectives and attack enemies, such as utilizing Cooper's Pilot stealth ability, jump-kit assisted traversal
        of the level and using firearms provided in the game. Levels are large, and there are multiple paths for players to choose from to reach their destination.The game also features platform elements, which task players to make use of Cooper's parkour
        abilities to solve environmental puzzles, and travel to previously inaccessible areas. Some weapons are level-specific and can only be used in certain areas.There are also level-specific gameplay mechanics. For instance, in the "Effect and Cause"
        level, players are required to shift between the present and past with the 'OPERATION: GRIZZLY' temporal device.Players can also select dialogue options and have Cooper talk to BT-7274 at certain points in the campaign to develop the characters'
        personalities and often to comedic effect.The single-player also features a training gauntlet, which acts as a tutorial for players. The faster they complete the gauntlet, the higher their position will be on a leaderboard.</h2>

            <li>Bounty Hunt: Players are rewarded with money if they kill enemies, opponents or AI-controlled grunts. Players need to return to specific points to deposit the money. Players can also steal opponents' money by killing them. The team that has
                the highest score wins.</li>

            <li>Capture the Flag: Players are tasked to capture the flag of an enemy and bring it to their team's base, while preventing opponents from stealing the player's flag.</li>

            <li>Attrition: A standard team deathmatch mode in which players can summon Titans. Points are rewarded to a player's team when they kill a human-controlled enemy or an AI-controlled grunt. When a team earns enough points, the game transitions
                into the following phase: the losing team needs to reach the evacuation zone and escape, while the winning team needs to eliminate all opponents.</li>

            <li>Skirmish: This mode is like Attrition, but there is no AI-controlled grunts and the score needed for phase transitioning is lower.</li>

            <li>Last Titan Standing: A last player standing mode, where the first team to eliminate all opposing titans wins. Players are spawned in their titan and can collect batteries scattered around the map.</li>

            <li>Free for All: Players are tasked to kill each other in this mode. All other players will be marked as their opponents.</li>

            <li>Coliseum: This is a one-versus-one multiplayer mode where the player is tasked to eliminate the other player. Players can gain access to this mode through Coliseum tickets. These are earned by playing other multiplayer modes, buying them with
                credits, or receiving them in gifts granted when the player levels up a faction.</li>

    <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 153, 255);text-align:left;">Matchmaking is also enhanced, with the game automatically helping players to find a new match after the end of every match.The game also introduces a new feature called "Networks", which allows players to form a group, similar to a guild. The game
        automatically groups both the player and other members of the network together in a match. Players can join more than one network and can switch between joined networks in-game.Each network has its own "happy hour". If the player plays the game
        during this period, they gain extra merits.</h2>
