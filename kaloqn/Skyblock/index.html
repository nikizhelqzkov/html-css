                <h1> Gameplay </h1>
                <p>
                    SkyBlock initially starts players on a small island. Players can use the resources on this island to bridge towards another nearby island, which contains a Jerry NPC, a Tier I Cobblestone Minion, and a portal to the Hub Island, a place containing several
                    areas and features to progress in the game.
                </p>
                <h1> Coins </h1>
                <p>
                    Coins are the main currency of SkyBlock, and are used to purchase shop items, bid on auctions, and purchase other items from other NPCs. Coins can be obtained by killing mobs, completing SkyBlock quests, selling items, and earning interest from the Bank.
                    Players will lose half of their held coins if they die in any non-Private Island, or die on their Private Island from causes excluding falling into the void by the players themselves.
                </p>
                <h1> Statistics </h1>
                <h2> Health </h2>
                <p>
                    Health serves at the amount of damage the player can sustain before dying. Health starts off at 100, but the base stat can be upgraded with Skills, Fairy Souls, and specific Quests. When a player's Health reaches 0, they will die and lose half of their
                    coins.
                </p>
                <h2> Defence </h2>
                <p>
                    Defense reduces the damage taken by Health from mobs and players. Base Defense can be upgraded with Skills and Fairy Souls.
                </p>
                <h2>Mana</h2>
                <p>
                    Mana, also known as Intelligence in statistics, is an aspect that allows players to use skills applied to their weapon. Mana initially has a limit of 100, but base Intelligence can be upgraded with Skills to increase the maximum Mana. If a player does
                    not have enough Mana points for a skill, they will have to wait until the Mana regenerates.
                </p>
                <h2>Strength</h2>
                <p>
                    Strength affects the overall damage dealt to mobs or players. The base Strength stat can be upgraded with Skills and Fairy Souls.
                </p>
                <h2> Speed </h2>
                <p>
                    Speed affects the velocity of the player when moving. The base Speed stat can be upgraded with Fairy Souls.
                </p>
                <h2> Crit Chance/Damage </h2>
                <p>
                    Crit Chance and Crit Damage are stats that affect the power and frequency of Critical hits on mobs or players. Base Crit Chance can be upgraded with Skills, and base Crit Damage can be upgraded with specific quests. If a player lands a critical hit, the
                    damage indicator will be colored red to white, and stars will be next to the amount of damage.
                </p>
                <h1> Mechanics </h1>
                <h2> Bank </h2>

                    The Bank is a system and location in the SkyBlock Hub Island. Players can go to the bank to deposit or withdraw coins, and players can also see the 10 most recent transactions in the Bank. The bank also rewards 2% interest to players for keeping their
                    coins in the bank, which is given every 31 real time hours. The Bank can be accessed elsewhere using the Personal Bank in the SkyBlock Menu, or the Personal Bank item. The Personal Bank initially has a cooldown that can be reduced
                    to no cooldown by unlocking Emerald collections and paying coins to the Guy NPC found west of the Hub Island Bank.
                </p>
                <h2> Collections </h2>
                <p>

                    minions. Collections are split into five different categories of items, those being Farming, Mining, Combat, Foraging, and Fishing.
                </p>
                <h2>Minions</h2>
                <p>
                    Minions are automatic workers unlocked in the first level of any collection. They can be placed on an island and require a working space fit to their preference to work. Minions can be upgraded with the items they are tasked to collect, and upgrading
                    Minions will increase their working speed and inventory space. Minion Upgrades and other items are available for Minions to create specific perks, such as compacting items, automatically selling items, and increasing storage.
                </p>
                <h2> Quests </h2>
                <p>
                    Quests are tasks assigned to players in different areas. These Quests usually give players useful items or other rewards. Incomplete and ongoing Quests can be viewed through the Quest Log in the SkyBlock Menu, and ongoing Quests will show the next step
                    to progress the Quest to completion.
                </p>
                <h2>Reforaging</h2>
                <p>
                    Reforging is a process in which players can give items to the Blacksmith NPC in the Hub Island and gain permanent stat upgrades on their weapons. These upgrades usually affect offensive stats, though they can also affect stats like Intelligence. Reforges
                    cost coins to complete, and the price varies by the rarity of the item. Armor, Weapons, and Talismans can be reforged at the Blacksmith NPC.
                </p>
                <h2>Talismans</h2>
                <p>

                <p>
                    Shops are structures with NPCs placed around the hub's spawn point. These shops are split into several categories of items, with an NPC corresponding to the shop's contents. Players can also sell almost any item at any shop by clicking on the item they
                    desire to sell. Shops have limits on some collection items where players can only purchase 640 of a single item each day.
                </p>
                <h2>Areas</h2>
